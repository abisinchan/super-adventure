    -The function(key){ ... } part is the "something" you do for each name. Here, key is a  placeholder for each name as you go through the list.

    Inside the forEach: notes.push(document.getElementById(key));:
    -document.getElementById(key) is like asking, "Hey, on my webpage, can you find the part that has this specific name?"
    -Each key in your list of names is used to find a specific part of your webpage.
    When it finds that part of the webpage, notes.push(...) is like adding that part to a new list called notes.

    -This is like going through a shopping list (keys), finding each item in the store, and then putting them in your cart (notes).
